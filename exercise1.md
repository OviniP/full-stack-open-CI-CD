Let's assume a software project developed using C# .NET. Setting up a CI pipeline for the project mainly includes linting, testing, and building. Popular tools used for linting can be mentioned as StyleCop, Roslyn Analyzers, SonarQube, and ReSharper. Testing for the C# project can be done with one of the popular tools such as MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit. MSBuild is the default build tool used in the C# ecosystem. Another build automation tool, Cake (C# Make), can be used for writing build scripts in C#.

Multiple options are available to configure a CI pipeline for a C# project. Microsoft's ecosystem includes Azure DevOps, but we are free to use other popular tools such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins. Besides these three, here is a list of other options that can be used to set up a CI pipeline: GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI, Bamboo, TeamCity, Codeship, Bitbucket Pipelines, Buddy, and Drone.

Selecting the hosting environment, either self-hosted or cloud-based, depends on the requirements of the project. Cloud-based systems offer a vast range of features such as scalability, maintainability, accessibility, integration, and pay-as-you-go billing models. On the other side, a self-hosted environment is best suited for large projects with high security requirements. Since the hypothetical project given in the scenario is a 6-developer team project, I believe a cloud-based deployment setup would work for it.
